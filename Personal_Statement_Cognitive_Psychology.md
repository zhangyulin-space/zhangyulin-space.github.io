# Personal Statement - Cognitive Psychology

## Why do you want to study this course or subject?

My fascination with cognitive psychology stems from a profound curiosity about the fundamental question: how does the human mind work? This interest was ignited through my deep engagement with Noam Chomsky's revolutionary insights into language acquisition and Universal Grammar. Through extensive study of his critique of Large Language Models, I have come to appreciate the elegant efficiency of human cognition—how children acquire complex language systems from limited input, suggesting innate cognitive structures that current AI systems lack.

What captivates me most about cognitive psychology is its interdisciplinary nature, seamlessly bridging neuroscience, linguistics, philosophy, and computer science to address fundamental questions about human nature. My research into embodied cognition has been particularly revelatory, showing how our understanding of language and meaning extends far beyond abstract symbol manipulation. The discovery that comprehending action words like "kick" activates our motor cortex—as if we were performing the action ourselves—has fundamentally transformed my understanding of cognition from a purely computational process to a dynamic, embodied phenomenon rooted in our physical experiences.

I am particularly drawn to the ongoing theoretical debates that define the field: the tension between symbolic and embodied approaches to cognition, the symbol grounding problem, and questions about the modularity of mind. These debates are not merely academic—they have profound implications for understanding human uniqueness, consciousness, and our relationship with increasingly sophisticated artificial intelligence systems. The field's potential to illuminate the nature of intelligence itself, while contributing to practical applications in education, therapy, and technology, makes it an intellectually compelling and socially relevant pursuit.

## How have your qualifications and studies helped you to prepare for this course or subject?

My academic preparation has provided me with a robust foundation across the interdisciplinary domains essential for cognitive psychology. Through systematic engagement with cognitive science literature, I have developed sophisticated analytical skills, particularly in evaluating competing theoretical frameworks and synthesizing evidence from multiple research paradigms.

My comprehensive study of language and the brain has equipped me with detailed knowledge of neuroanatomical structures crucial to language processing, including Broca's and Wernicke's areas, the arcuate fasciculus, and the broader neural networks revealed by modern neuroimaging. I have critically examined evidence from fMRI and PET studies, developing both an appreciation for the power of these methodologies and an understanding of their limitations in revealing causal relationships between brain activity and cognitive function.

Particularly valuable has been my analysis of the embodied cognition literature, where I have engaged deeply with theoretical controversies such as the Fodor-Barsalou debate over the nature of mental representation. This work has honed my ability to critically evaluate empirical evidence, understand how methodological choices influence theoretical conclusions, and appreciate the complexity of drawing inferences about cognitive architecture from behavioral and neurological data.

My extensive study of Chomskyan linguistics has provided me with a sophisticated understanding of formal approaches to language, including Universal Grammar, the poverty of the stimulus argument, and the competence-performance distinction. This theoretical grounding has been invaluable in understanding how cognitive psychology approaches fundamental questions about innate knowledge, learning mechanisms, and the relationship between linguistic theory and psychological reality.

Furthermore, my research into artificial intelligence and machine learning has given me unique insights into computational approaches to cognition. This background allows me to understand both the potential contributions and fundamental limitations of current AI systems in modeling human cognitive processes, providing a valuable comparative perspective on human intelligence.

## What else have you done to prepare outside of education, and why are these experiences useful?

Beyond formal academic study, I have undertaken several self-directed activities that have significantly deepened my preparation for advanced study in cognitive psychology.

I have developed and maintained a comprehensive digital knowledge repository, systematically documenting my intellectual journey through complex topics including embodied simulation, the symbol grounding problem, modular perception theories, and contemporary AI-cognition debates. This practice has cultivated essential research skills: the ability to synthesize complex information across disciplines, identify theoretical connections that might not be immediately apparent, and maintain rigorous documentation standards crucial for academic research.

My active engagement with contemporary scholarly discourse—particularly through critical analysis of academic lectures, research presentations, and theoretical debates—has kept me current with cutting-edge developments in the field. This engagement has sharpened my ability to evaluate emerging ideas critically, understand how theoretical positions evolve in response to new evidence, and appreciate the dynamic nature of scientific knowledge in cognitive psychology.

Most significantly, I have conducted independent research investigating the linguistic processing of disgust metaphors, drawing on Conceptual Metaphor Theory and embodied cognition frameworks. This study utilized facial electromyography (EMG) and subjective assessments to examine the physiological and emotional responses to different types of metaphors—contrasting ontological metaphors anchored in sensory experiences with orientational metaphors based on spatial schemas. The research was designed to test competing theories regarding the embodiment of metaphorical language, specifically investigating whether the cognitive and physiological instantiation of these metaphors demonstrates universality or linguistic specificity. This hands-on research experience has provided me with practical knowledge of psychophysiological methods, experimental design principles, and the complexities of studying embodied cognition empirically.

Particularly valuable has been my practice of reflective analysis, where I connect theoretical concepts to personal cognitive experiences. For example, my realization that "language involves perception, action, and memory systems across the brain" emerged from integrating theoretical knowledge with introspective observation—precisely the kind of integrative thinking that characterizes excellent cognitive psychology research. This approach has developed my capacity for the metacognitive awareness essential for both conducting research and understanding the subjective aspects of cognition.

My systematic approach to connecting diverse knowledge domains—from Chomskyan linguistics to embodied cognition to AI critique—has cultivated the interdisciplinary thinking skills essential for cognitive psychology. This preparation has equipped me not merely with factual knowledge, but with the intellectual flexibility, methodological sophistication, and genuine curiosity necessary to contribute meaningfully to advancing our understanding of human cognition.

These experiences have fostered the research independence, critical thinking capabilities, and sustained intellectual engagement that will enable me to thrive in a demanding cognitive psychology program and contribute to the field's ongoing development.
