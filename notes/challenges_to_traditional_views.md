# 💥 Challenges to Traditional Views of the Mind

Traditional cognitive science treated the mind as a **symbol-processing machine**. But embodied cognition challenges this computer-like view.

---

## 💻 1. The Classical View

- **Mind = software**, **Brain = hardware**
- Inspired by symbolic AI (Turing, Newell, Simon)
- Knowledge is stored as abstract symbols
- Cognition is independent of body or brain structure

---

## 🧠 2. Embodied Rebuttal

- Mind is **not disembodied**
- The body and the brain **shape cognition**
- Meaning is grounded in **sensorimotor experience**
- Understanding the mind requires studying **neural and bodily systems**

---

## 🔬 3. Why This Matters

If the brain and body matter, then:

- Psychology must consider **neurobiology**
- AI must include **perception and action**
- Language is not just syntax — it’s **experience-based**

---

## 💭 4. My Thoughts

This shift feels like a revolution. It reminds me that cognition isn’t just “thinking” in the abstract — it’s **living**, **acting**, **perceiving**, and **feeling**.

A truly intelligent system must be **embodied**, not just symbolic.
