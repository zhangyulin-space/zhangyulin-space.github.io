# 🧱 Perception as Modular (Fodor, 1985)

Jerry Fodor’s theory of modularity argues that **perception is carried out by specialized, encapsulated modules** in the brain. This has major implications for how we understand the mind.

## 🧠 1. What Is a Module?

A "module" is a **domain-specific, fast, automatic, and cognitively impenetrable** processing unit.

### Core Features:

- **Fast** �?operates quickly and efficiently
- **Automatic** �?triggered by stimuli
- **Encapsulated** �?not affected by beliefs or expectations
- **Domain-specific** �?handles only one kind of input (e.g. faces, sounds)

## 👁�?2. Examples of Perceptual Modules

- **Face perception**
- **Color vision**
- **Speech recognition**
- **Depth perception**

These modules work independently of our conscious thoughts.

## 🧠 3. Perception vs. Cognition (Fodor’s View)

| Feature        | Perception (Modular) | Cognition (Central)    |
|----------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|
| Speed          | Fast                  | Slow                    |
| Flexibility    | Inflexible            | Flexible                |
| Interactivity  | None                  | High                    |
| Format         | Sensory               | Abstract                |

## 🤔 4. Embodied Challenge

Embodied cognition challenges this view:

> If cognition involves **simulation**, and simulation involves **perception**, then perception and cognition are not separate.

---

## 💭 5. My Thoughts

Fodor’s theory is elegant, but perhaps too rigid. In real life, our expectations **do** change what we see �?think of optical illusions or how mood affects perception.

Maybe modules exist, but they interact more than Fodor believed. The line between perception and thought may be **blurrier** than he imagined.
