# ðŸ§ª Testing Embodied Cognition

If meaning is embodied, we should be able to test it by looking at how the brain and body respond to language.

---

## ðŸ§  1. Key Question

> Does understanding a word activate **modality-specific brain systems**?

---

## ðŸ”¬ 2. Neuroimaging Evidence

- fMRI shows **motor cortex** activation for action verbs
- Visual words (e.g. "bright", "red") activate **visual cortex**
- Auditory words (e.g. "buzz") activate **auditory cortex**

---

## ï¿½?3. Behavioral Evidence

- **Interference tasks**: doing a motor task slows comprehension of action words
- **Response time studies**: people are faster when simulation matches action (e.g. â€œpushï¿½?while pushing)

---

## ðŸ§ª 4. ERP Studies

- Event-Related Potentials show early activation in modality-specific areas ï¿½?within 200ms of reading a word
- Suggests **automatic simulation**, not post-hoc inference

## ðŸ“Š 5. Summary

| Test Type       | What It Shows                        |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|
| fMRI             | Activation of sensory/motor systems  |
| ERP              | Timing of simulation                 |
| Behavior         | Interference and facilitation effects|

## ðŸ’­ 6. My Thoughts

Itâ€™s amazing that **just reading** a word like â€œrunï¿½?can activate the same brain areas as **actually running**. This gives real weight to the idea that **understanding = simulation**.

Embodiment isnâ€™t just a theory ï¿½?itâ€™s a measurable, testable process.
