# ğŸ¤– Embodied Simulation Hypothesis

The **simulation hypothesis** offers a radical rethinking of how we understand concepts and language.

---

## ğŸ§  1. What Is Simulation?

Simulation is the brainâ€™s ability to **recreate past sensory-motor experiences** in the absence of direct input.

> To remember â€œappleâ€?is to simulate how it looks, feels, tastes.

## ğŸ§© 2. Simulation in Cognition

- Concepts are not stored as static definitions
- Instead, we **simulate** relevant experiences
- Thinking = â€œreplayingâ€?aspects of perception and action

---

## ğŸ” 3. Perception and Thought Reuse the Same Systems

- Visual imagery uses **visual cortex**
- Motor imagery uses **motor cortex**
- Language comprehension uses both (depending on word type)

---

## ğŸ’¡ 4. Examples

- Hearing "bark" â†?simulate sound (auditory)
- Reading "run" â†?simulate movement (motor)
- Reading "sunset" â†?simulate colors/scenery (visual)

---

## ğŸ’­ 5. My Reflection

This changed my view of thinking. I used to imagine the brain as a computer sorting symbols. But now I see it as a **re-experiencing machine** â€?using the past to make sense of the present.

Simulation is not just a metaphor â€?itâ€™s a **neural reality**.
