# ðŸ§  Cognitive Psychology Notes

Welcome to my personal study notes on **Cognitive Psychology and Embodied Cognition**, based on lectures, readings, and research in the field. This site is a growing collection of concepts, theories, and experiments that explore how the mind works â€” grounded in the brain, the body, and experience.
## ðŸ“š What You'll Find Here

- Key theories in language and cognition  
- Classic and modern models of the mind  
- Embodied cognition vs. symbolic computation  
- Symbol grounding problem and simulation theory  
- Brain areas involved in perception and meaning  
- Summaries of influential researchers (e.g. Fodor, Barsalou, Casasanto)

## âœ¨ Why This Matters

Understanding cognition is not just about abstract logic or symbol manipulation â€” it's also about how our **bodies, brains, and environments** shape the way we think, speak, and understand the world.
